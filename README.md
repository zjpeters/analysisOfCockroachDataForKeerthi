# analysisOfCockroachDataForKeerthi

Python code for plotting data related to cockroach preferred stimulus data

## Running the code

This repository is setup to include the spreadsheets to be used within the `rawdata` folder, store any output figures or data in the `derivatives` folder, and all code in the `code` folder. 

Inside the code file `cockroachPreferencePlotting.py` you will need to change the locations given for the rawdata and derivatives variables to the equivalent locations on your computer. You can copy any additional spreadsheets into the `rawdata` folder and import them in the same way. 

## Types of plots

I've put together 3 types of plots within this code:

1. Violin plots with overlaid scatter

2. Box plots with overlaid scatter

3. A stacked bar plot for the preference of each group
